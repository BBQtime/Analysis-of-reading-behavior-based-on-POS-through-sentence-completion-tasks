# Analysis-of-reading-behavior-based-on-POS-through-sentence-completion-tasks

In this paper, we evaluate the reaction of people’s behavior towards information
from reading incomplete sentence based on their eye movements’ metrics while they
try to fill the missing word.The experiment has potential meaning for psycholinguistics as well, however, this paper only uncovers the relationship between part of
speech(POS) and the missing word in one sentence, or how syntactic works with incomplete grammar dependency of POS. We discovered that fixation metrics perform
differently under missing word scenario with ordinary reading tasks. Through an
eye-tracking experiment, the eye tracker obtained eye measurements from 19 subjects in 2 groups of missing word sentences of different POS. In the first group of
the stimuli, there was 30 individual Noun missing sentences, and in the other group,
30 individual Verb missing sentences are placed. Gaze metrics of each AOIs(tokens
of a sentence) were obtained over 19 subjects, a qualitative analysis was conducted
afterward based on the mean of total fixation duration on AOIs.
